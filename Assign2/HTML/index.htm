            <h2>My Name is Jeff Gibson, I am a first year Computer Science student at Mcmaster University.</h2>
            <p>I am a very motivated person both at school as well as in the work place, especially when working around other talented, and driven people. I have strong verbal and written communication skills which allow me to work well with a team, and I am proficient in python, C++, VisualBasic, Haskell as well as Elm.</p>

            <h2>Haskell Projects</h2>
            <p>Haskell was the first functional language I learned, and I continue to learn it today. I am comfortable creating custom data structures, as well as writing monoidal, functor, applicative and monadic instances for such data structures. In addition, I have written an expression data type and parser to convert from strings to the expression data type which can partially or fully evaluate expressions it is given, as well as perform some other functionality.</p>

            <p>I have created many small games and apps using Elm, as well as one larger game for which a link can be found on this page, and on my school github. The extent of these games and apps include both styling as well as creating a functional model for a game which handles user input and displaying it using svg objects.</p>

                        <p>
                                Part of how I fill my free-time is playing video games with friends. To name a few, I play: League of Legends, Counterstrike, Fortnite, as well as Rainbow Six Siege.
                                I am very appreciative of video games, as they played a large part in steering me towards studying Computer Science by inspiring me to attempt to code my own simple game,
                                which in turn opened my eyes to Computer Science as a whole.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Of course, being a Computer Science student would be silly if I didn't enjoy coding. I have attempted a few different types of projects, initially it was basic games,
                            as well as analysing and manipulating data. But eventually, I began to use coding for some more interesting things like steering an autonomous sumo-bot. 
                            Essentially coding has acted as an introduction to the more broad hobby of electronics and robotics which I enjoy today. (Click the picture to play my game)

                        <p>
                            As odd as this may sound, I do, sometimes enjoy getting up out of my chair and doing something a little more active. In fact, sports and general outdoor activities have
                            always been a big part of my life and that is no different today. While I no longer play baseball or volleyball competitively I still play pickup games with friends, and
                            I try to take advantage of being on the escarpment by going for hikes nearby!
